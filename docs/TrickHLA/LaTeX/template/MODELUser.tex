\section{Identification of Document}
This document describes the use of the
\MODEL\ developed for use in the Trick Simulation Environment.
This document adheres to the documentation standards defined in
NASA Software Engineering Requirements Standard \cite{NASA:SWE}.

\section{Scope of Document}
This document provides information on the use of the \MODEL.

\section{Purpose and Objectives of Document}
The purpose of this document is to describe how to incorporate the
\MODEL\ into a dynamic Trick simulation and used by other simulation models.

\section{Documentation Status and Schedule}
The information in this document is current with the \TrickHLAid\
implementation of the \MODEL. Updates will be kept current with
module changes.
