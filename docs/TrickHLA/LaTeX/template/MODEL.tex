\section{Identification of Document}
This document describes the \MODEL\ developed
for use in the Trick Simulation Environment.
This document adheres to the documentation standards
defined in NASA Software Engineering Requirements Standard \cite{NASA:SWE}.

\section{Scope of Document}
This document provides information on the
\begin{itemize}
\item the requirements for,
\item the algorithms used in and design of,
\item verification and validation of, and
\item the use of
\end{itemize}
the \MODEL. This included references to associated texts and the
presentation of various equations for COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

\section{Purpose and Objectives of Document}
The purpose of this document is to provide a thorough understanding of the
methods by which the \MODEL\ were defined, programmed, and verified.

\section{Documentation Status and Schedule}
The information in this document is current with the \TrickHLAid\ implementation
of the \MODEL\ modules. Updates will be kept current with module changes.
