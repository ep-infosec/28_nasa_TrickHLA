developed for use in the Trick Simulation Environment.
This document adheres to the documentation standards defined in
NASA Software Engineering Requirements Standard \cite{NASA:SWE}.

\section{Scope of Document}

application such as a dynamic simulation
used to certify the flight readiness of a space vehicle.

The purpose of this document is to define the set
of requirements that the \MODEL\ must achieve to enable
its use in Class C products.
